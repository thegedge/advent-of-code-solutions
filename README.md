These are my solutions to the 2022 advent of code. I'm not a "code golf" kind of person, so these are just me enjoying
the experience of solving problems, not trying to always find a clever solution or fitting that solution into as few
characters as possible.

I'm trying my best to comment on various aspects, so anyone reading these solutions can learn how I came about them.
Feel free to open up an issue if you'd like me to expand on or clarify any piece of code. I'm always happy to teach :)

These days I've been working in TypeScript for my day job, so I've opted to solve problems with JavaScript. I was
curious what it would be like to solve this style of problem with node.
