These are my solutions to the 2022 advent of code. I'm not a "code golf" kind of
person, so these are just me enjoying the experience of solving problems, not
trying to always find a clever solution or jam it into as few characters as
possible.

These days I've been working in TypeScript for my day job, so I've opted to
solve problems with JavaScript. I was curious what it would be like to solve
this style of problem with node :)
